This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



Hello!

Thank you for reviewing my app!

To get started you must have node.js and npm installed. Then:

* Please clone or copy the repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

The Neighborhood React app is intended to allow the user to search for locations around my hometown of Cadillac, MI and the surrounding area.

Once your area of interest is typed into the search bar, simply click enter to see a list of locations and corresponding markers.

Location information and photos provided by Foursquare.

Enjoy!
